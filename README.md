## Hey there!

### A little about me...
I served as an All-Source Intelligence Analyst in the U.S. Army since October 2013 and plan to transition to civilian life in May 2026.
I completed a 3-month accelerated Data Science program and am actively pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Data Science through Arizona State University.
I'm currently focused on both computer vision and hope to find a career as a computer vision engineer.
