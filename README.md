## Hey there!

### A little about me...
I have served as an All-Source Intelligence Analyst in the U.S. Army since October 2013 and plan to transition to a role in intelligence on the civilian side in May 2026.
In April 2025, I completed a 3-month accelerated Data Science program provided to veterans by Galvanize's Hack Reactor and realized that Data Science represents the automation of analytic workflows I performed manually for years.
I'm also actively pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Data Science through Arizona State University in attempt to professionalize this new skill as a force-multiplier within my domain of expertise. 

### My interests...
- Learning (I love it and hope to never stop!)
- Kayaking
- Reading
- Cooking
