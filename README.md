## Hey there!

### A little about me...
I have served as an All-Source Intelligence Analyst in the U.S. Army since October 2013 and plan to transition to civilian life in May 2026.
In April 2025, I completed a 3-month accelerated Data Science program provided to veterans by Galvanize's Hack Reactor. I'm also actively pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Data Science through Arizona State University.
